Cookiecutter Data Science (CCDS) Template Explained

This document outlines every directory and key file in the standard Cookiecutter Data Science template. For each component, we describe:

Contents: What types of files belong here

Connections: How it relates to other parts of the project

Benefits: Why separation improves organization, reproducibility, and collaboration

📄 Root-Level Files

README.md

Contents: Project overview, usage instructions, folder structure, dependencies

Connections: Entry point for new contributors; links to scripts in /src, data directories, and reports

Benefits: Centralizes documentation; makes onboarding simple and ensures users know how to reproduce the pipeline

LICENSE

Contents: Legal terms governing project use (e.g., MIT)

Connections: Applies license to all code, data, and documentation in the repo

Benefits: Clarifies permissions and responsibilities for open-source sharing

environment.yml (or requirements.txt)

Contents: Exact Python packages and versions needed

Connections: Used in CI, local setup, Docker, or Binder to recreate the same environment as the developer’s

Benefits: Guarantees that code runs identically across machines, eliminating “it works on my laptop” issues

.gitignore

Contents: Patterns for files/folders to exclude from version control (e.g., *.pyc, /data/raw/)

Connections: Prevents large or sensitive files from polluting the repo; works alongside .gitattributes if present

Benefits: Keeps repository lightweight, secure, and focused on source files

Makefile (optional)

Contents: Predefined commands (e.g., make data, make train, make test)

Connections: Automates sequential tasks; can call scripts in /src or notebooks

Benefits: Provides one-command reproducibility for entire pipeline or individual steps

🗄 Data Management

data/
├── raw/
├── interim/
└── processed/

data/raw/

Contents: Immutable original data (CSV, JSON, downloads)

Relations: Source for all downstream cleaning and feature engineering

data/interim/

Contents: Partially cleaned or merged datasets used as intermediate checkpoints

Relations: Bridges raw ingestion and final processing; useful for debugging pipeline steps

data/processed/

Contents: Fully cleaned, feature-engineered datasets ready for modeling

Relations: Direct input to training scripts, notebooks, and visualization modules

Benefits of Separation: Keeping raw, interim, and processed data in distinct folders prevents accidental overwrites of original files and makes it easy to trace the output of each processing step.

📓 Notebooks

notebooks/

Contents: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), prototyping, and narrative-driven steps

Connections: Often import functions from /src; read from data/processed/ and write plots to reports/figures/

Benefits: Encapsulates exploratory work separately from production code; notebooks serve as living documentation for analysis choices

📦 Source Code

src/
├── data/
└── models/

Contents: Modular Python scripts and packages (.py files) implementing data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation

Connections: Core logic that powers both notebooks and command-line scripts; may be installed via setup.py or pyproject.toml for importable modules

Benefits: Encourages DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles; separates reusable functions from ad-hoc analysis in notebooks

🧠 Models

models/

Contents: Serialized trained models (pickle, joblib), training logs, hyperparameter configurations

Connections: Used in evaluation scripts, visualizations, and deployment pipelines; often loaded by run_visualizations.py or inference scripts

Benefits: Keeps large binary artifacts separate from code, making version control and storage management cleaner

📊 Reports & Figures

reports/
└── figures/

reports/: Final documents (PDFs, slides) and subfolders like figures/ for plots

reports/figures/: All generated images (PNG, SVG) used in reports or presentations

Connections: Created by visualization scripts or notebooks; consumed by slides and final deliverables

Benefits: Centralizes outputs so users can find charts without digging through code or data folders

📚 References & Documentation

references/
docs/

references/: Static files such as academic papers, dataset dictionaries, and external resources

docs/: Project documentation (Sphinx, MkDocs) for publishing a documentation website

Connections: References inform literature review; docs tie everything together in a navigable site

Benefits: Separates supporting materials from code and data; enhances transparency and reproducibility

✔️ Tests (optional)

tests/

Contents: Unit tests, integration tests, and fixtures to validate code in /src

Connections: Ensures changes to source code don’t break pipeline functionality; often run in CI on each commit

Benefits: Provides automated checks to maintain code quality and reproducibility over time

By dividing responsibilities across these directories and files, the CCDS template enforces a clean, modular project layout. This organization supports reproducible research, eases collaboration, and makes each step of the data science workflow transparent and maintainable.
